#Description:
This is my own work for doing html and css to developed a website. It's just basically have some of very commonly function
that you can see every kind of website can had. Although it is very simple, it also take me many times to understand 
and update. Almost the function work well but i think it could be more well if i do more understand about the html and javascript code. 
Thank you for reading and checking my code!!!

#Feature:
My webiste has 4 main function

The first one named Do_Chage(), which can replace image after user choosing the button named 'Picture 1', 'Picture 2', ... 'Picture 5'

The second named Toggle_Theme(), which can bascially change the theme of website.
It can be change the theme and then store it to current them. Even the user refresh the page, it will still using the lastest theme.

The third named show_the_time(), which can display the current time to screen and updated every seconds.

The four one named change_heading(). When user type their name to blank square, the screen will pop up the message to user and change the heading to 
their name and store it. Even the user refresh the page will still using the lastest user name type in.
